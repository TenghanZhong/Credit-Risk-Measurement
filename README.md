# Credit Risk Measurement Models

This repository primarily examines the discriminative performance of the Z-Score model, Logistic model, KMV model, and the improved KMV model in differentiating between ST and non-ST companies. Additionally, it employs the Credit Metrics model to measure the Value at Risk (VaR) for individual bonds and bond portfolios.

Furthermore, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of these four models. Our findings reveal that each model is suited to specific scenarios and conditions. Therefore, selecting the appropriate credit risk measurement model requires careful consideration of a company's characteristics, data availability, and application objectives.
